A temporary project created to find a proper way to use my C++ project on virtual machine of mail.ru.

Steps from old and working C version to new C++ version that is alas still rejected by their test scripts:

1. Same C version, only using newer version of compiler
2. Same C version, but compiled with C++ compiler
3. C version now with daemonization in C++ style
4. C version with C++ daemonization and threads
